        "The second way \"import numpy as np\" is the most common. The \"as np\" gives a shortcut name \"np\" to numpy, to make coding easier. You can change the shortcut \"np\" to be anything you like. All functions within NumPy have to be explicitly referenced with code like \"numpy.array\", \"numpy.max\", or \"np.array\" and \"np.max\", depending on how you imported NumPy.\n",

With the third option, you have only imported the function \"array\", and can use it without the \"numpy\" or \"np\" prefix. Nothing else from NumPy is imported. The third option is almost never used with NumPy, but is often used for specialty packages when you only need to import a specific function.\n",
