        "Direct solvers for linear systems typically struggle with large systems of linear equations. When the matrix $A$ is has some structure, such as symmetric positive definitene and sparae, there are far more efficient solvers based on indirect iterative methods. Below we use the conjugate gradient method (covered in chapters 6 and 11 of the textbook) to solve a linear system with a matrix $A$ of the same form as above, but much larger. In this case, we use the `scipy` package, which has support for sparse matrices. The conjugage gradient method is "
