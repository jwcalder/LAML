        "5. [Challenging] Write a compression algorithm that chooses the best singular vectors to use for each block, instead of the top $k$. To do this, choose a threshold $\\mu>0$, project the image blocks onto all of the singular vectors, and then discard (i.e., set to zero) any coefficient (i.e., PCA coordinate) that is smaller than $\\mu$. Reconstruct the image from the truncated blocks, and compute the compression ratio assuming you do not have to store the zeros (the coefficients that were threshold ed to zero), and assume you don't need to store the singular vectors (the setting is that you learn good singular vectors, and then share them between the encoder and decoder, so only the coefficients must be transmitted/stored). How does this compare with the block-based method in this notebook? \n",
